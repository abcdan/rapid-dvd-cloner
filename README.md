# rapid-dvd-cloner
Copying a bulk of DVDs to my PC took a long time, had to automate the folder creation.


## What is it?
It's just a script that allows me to copy a DVD to a folder. Nothing more

## WARNING
The code is a big mess. I just had to write it quickly so it contains a hardcoded variable that's for my drive. In the future, I'll refactor the code to be readable instead of this mess. To recruiters, this is not how I write code but I just had to get something to work fast.

More info soon!
